# updating unrar DLL

Upgrading unrar DLL is simple:

    - download the latest release from https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm (titled "UnRAR release source" at the time of writing)
    - extract the tarball into this directory (top level directory is `unrar/` in both cases)
    - apply the patches from [`patches.txt`](./patches.txt): `git add unrar && cat patches.txt | xargs git cherry-pick -n`

The small script [`upgrade.sh`](./upgrade.sh) will automate these steps if you provide it the URL to the tarball, e.g.:

```bash
./upgrade.sh https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-6.2.12.tar.gz
```
